### Usage:  
First install requirements using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the program by running
```
python main.py <fold_algorithm> <dimensions> [C]
```

where `<fold_algorithm`> is the filename (without .py) of one of the algorithms in the code/algorithms folder, 
`<dimensions`> is either 2 or 3 for 2D or 3D folding, respectively, and the optional argument `[C`] adds the
Cysteine aminoacid proteins.
